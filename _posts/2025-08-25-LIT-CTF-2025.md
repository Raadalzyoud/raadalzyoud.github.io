## Challenge Description

> *He looks familiar… Where is this?*  
>  
> **Flag format:** Use three decimal points of precision and round. The last digit of the first coordinate is ODD, and the last digit of the second coordinate is EVEN.  
> Example: `LITCTF{80.439,-23.498}`

We’re given a **Google Maps Street View link** and asked to identify the location.

---

## Approach

1. **Inspecting the Link**  
   Opening the given Google Maps Street View shows a statue in **Lexington, Massachusetts**. The description mentions *Captain John Parker Statue*.  

   Captain John Parker was a militia leader during the **Battle of Lexington (1775)**, making this a historically notable landmark.

2. **Extracting Coordinates**  
   From Google Maps, the coordinates are:  https://www.google.com/maps/place/Captain+John+Parker+Statue/@42.4488315,-71.2299853,3a,75y,305.21h,90t/data=!3m10!1e1!3m8!1scZsex3gTuARDj55Gf982qA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D0%26panoid%3DcZsex3gTuARDj55Gf982qA%26yaw%3D305.20671104058806!7i16384!8i8192!9m2!1b1!2i51!4m15!1m8!3m7!1s0x89e39dd044394067:0x633747e130438b8c!2zTGV4aW5ndG9uIE1pbnV0ZSBNZW4gTWVtb3JpYWwsIEJlZGZvcmQgU3QsIExleGluZ3RvbiwgTUEgMDI0MjDYjCDYp9mE2YjZhNin2YrYp9iqINin2YTZhdiq2K3Yr9ip!3b1!8m2!3d42.4495566!4d-71.2299885!16s%2Fg%2F125_f03q_!3m5!1s0x89e39dd039858165:0xb53bab5e45bd8692!8m2!3d42.4489304!4d-71.2301105!16s%2Fg%2F11d_8g7cbv?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgxOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D 
   ```
   42.4488315, -71.2299853
   ```

3. **Applying the Flag Rules**  
   - Round to 3 decimal places.  
   - Ensure last digit of latitude = odd, longitude = even.  

   Calculation:  
   - Latitude: `42.4488315 → 42.449` ✅ (last digit 9, odd)  
   - Longitude: `-71.2299853 → -71.230` ✅ (last digit 0, even)

---

## Solution

The correctly formatted flag is:

```
LITCTF{42.449,-71.230}
```

---

## Notes

This was a fun **OSINT + GeoGuessr** style challenge. The trick was not just identifying the landmark but formatting the coordinates to satisfy the parity rule.

This is a GeoGuessr-style OSINT challenge where the goal is to identify the location based on a map link or image.

---

## Approach

1. **Examine Clues**
   Open the provided Google Maps link. Observe landmarks, signage, building style, vegetation, and any other identifying features.

2. **Search and Identify**
   Use Google Maps and Street View to pinpoint the exact location. Auxiliary tools like Google Lens or Yandex Images can help identify subtle clues.

3. **Extract Coordinates**
   The coordinates from Google Maps are: https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lake+Vista+Park/@-34.2470812,140.4645804,3a,75y,205.73h,90.47t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sD8okmaRR-jdL0Shxu-S-cg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-0.4651499561433923%26panoid%3DD8okmaRR-jdL0Shxu-S-cg%26yaw%3D205.7280820538017!7i16384!8i8192!4m15!1m8!3m7!1s0x6ac73a79ada40001:0xb04931d634230182!2sRiverland+High+Works!8m2!3d-34.2553967!4d140.4692383!10e5!16s%2Fg%2F11qgt32mr_!3m5!1s0x6ac731003375f841:0x86c73df078c89b4a!8m2!3d-34.240747!4d140.4701!16s%2Fg%2F11w9zxnv7v?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgxOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D

   ```

4. **Apply Flag Rules**

   * Convert to decimal degrees.
   * Round to three decimal places.
   * Ensure the last digit of the latitude is odd and the last digit of the longitude is even.

---

## Solution

Converting and rounding:

```
-34.247, 140.464
```

This satisfies the flag format. The final flag is:

```
LITCTF{-34.247,140.464}
```

---

## Notes

The challenge tests your OSINT and GeoGuessr skills. Correct rounding and parity of the coordinates are essential to form the valid flag.

![Desktop View](/geoguessr3.png){: width="600" height="350" }

---

## Approach

1. **Open the Google Maps Link**
   Click on the provided link to view the Street View image.

2. **Identify Landmarks and Clues**
   Look for distinctive features such as signage, architecture, vegetation, or any text that could provide hints about the location.

3. **Use Reverse Image Search (Optional)**
   If the Street View image contains unique elements, you can use tools like Google Lens or Yandex Images to perform a reverse image search and find similar images online.

4. **Determine the Coordinates**
   Once the location is identified, use Google Maps to obtain the exact coordinates: https://www.google.com/maps/@46.781152,-56.1714238,3a,43.9y,70.12h,80.45t/data=!3m11!1e1!3m9!1sCIHM0ogKEICAgIC6pfarTA!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fgpms-cs-s%2FAB8u6HZjQVOsct0tsCfydzp1x7xXw-NOYO3UQGLW3hOxUWeGvxp9-M49bNav0QOmXHKpAJmO-ZQxjtZp7BVznE9bhaHlLvAHVF9ouXhyeIFSRlkHPvgdVWqqh8XeZdWFk1Eyp2do49Jy%3Dw900-h600-k-no-pi9.549999999999997-ya173.32669555664063-ro0-fo100!7i7680!8i3840!9m2!1b1!2i49?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgxOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D

   ```
   46.781152, -56.1714238
   ```

5. **Apply the Flag Format Rules**

   * Round the coordinates to **three decimal places**.
   * Ensure the last digit of the latitude is **odd**.
   * Ensure the last digit of the longitude is **odd**.

---

## Solution

After rounding and applying parity rules:

```
LITCTF{46.781,-56.171}
```

---

## Notes

This challenge tests your ability to identify locations using Google Maps and apply specific formatting rules to the coordinates. Attention to detail is crucial, especially when rounding and ensuring the correct parity of the coordinate digits.

## Challenge Description

> The yourdidit star is back, and it's hiding something from you...  
>  
> You are given a file named `yourdidit`. Your task is to find the hidden message.

---

## Approach

1. **Inspect the File**  
   Running the `strings` command on the file reveals some PNG-related headers and a suspicious comment:  

   ```bash
   ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop]
   └─$ strings yourdidit
   IHDR
   sRGB
   gAMA
           pHYs
   ,tEXtComment
   TElUQ1RGezN4MWZ0ME8xX2FkbTE3c18wcnp9
   ```

2. **Identify Hidden Data**  
   The line starting with `TElUQ1RG...` looks like **Base64-encoded data**. This is a common technique to hide a flag inside image metadata (EXIF or textual chunks in PNG).

3. **Decode Base64**  
   Using `base64 -d` or an online decoder on:  

   ```
   TElUQ1RGezN4MWZ0ME8xX2FkbTE3c18wcnp9
   ```

   Results in the flag:

   ```
   LITCTF{3x1ft0O1_adm17s_0rz}
   ```

---

## Solution

The flag for this challenge is:

```
LITCTF{3x1ft0O1_adm17s_0rz}
```

---

## Notes

This challenge demonstrates **steganography in image files**. The key steps were:

- Inspecting the file for textual content using `strings`.
- Recognizing the Base64 encoding inside the PNG comment chunk.
- Decoding the Base64 to retrieve the hidden flag.

# MISC/Cool New Font!

---

## Challenge Description
We’re given a simple webpage with a strange message:

```html
<p id="hint">Oh no... I can't find my flag!</p>
<!--  <p id="text">JTHEHN{mxY_upDk-dKVmsXxq_KmkG}</p> -->
```

JavaScript disabled right-click, devtools, and `Ctrl+U` (view source), but this is just a distraction — the HTML source already shows a suspicious commented-out string:

```
JTHEHN{mxY_upDk-dKVmsXxq_KmkG}
```

At first glance it looks like a flag, but it doesn’t match the usual `LITCTF{...}` format. The title and hint suggest that the “cool new font” is the key.

---

## Inspect the CSS
Looking at `styles.css` revealed:

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Fun';
    src: url('Fun-Regular.ttf');
}
```

So the webpage uses a **custom font** to render text. This hinted that the characters in the HTML aren’t what they look like — the glyphs are swapped inside the font file.

---

## Download and Analyze the Font
We downloaded the font:

```bash
wget http://litctf.org:31783/Fun-Regular.ttf
```

Then inspected it with **FontForge**:

```bash
sudo apt install fontforge
fontforge Fun-Regular.ttf
```

Inside FontForge, it became clear:  
- The codepoint for `J` actually looks like an `L`.  
- `T` looks like `I`.  
- `H` looks like `T`.  
- And so on…

Now we can clearly see the glyph mapping.

---

## Apply mapping to the encoded flag
From the font view, we extracted mappings:

```
JTHEHN → LITCTF
mxY     → yoU
_upDk   → _haVe
-dKVmsXxq → -vERygOod
_KmkG   → _EyeS

```

---
## Final Flag
```
LITCTF{yoU_haVe-vERygOod_EyeS}
```

# MISC/Languages1 

---

## Challenge Description

> My friend sent me a message! What does it say?  
>
> **Flag format:** `LITCTF{…}`  
> **All letters are uppercase.**  
>
> **Hints:**
> 1. ASL  
> 2. The flag can have numbers  
> 3. 0 does not appear in the flag  

We are also given a short video file (`lang.mp4`) to analyze.

---

## Analyzing the video

Opening the provided video `lang.mp4`, we see someone performing **hand signs**.  
Given the hint, this is clearly **ASL (American Sign Language)**.

Each sign corresponds to a letter or number in ASL.

<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="{{ '/assets/LITCTF/lang.mp4' | relative_url }}" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>


---

## Translating the signs

By carefully stepping through the video frame-by-frame and comparing the signs with an ASL alphabet chart, we decode each hand sign into English letters/numbers.

The translation yields:

```
LITCTF{ASLCOOL4NGUAG3SSS} 
```
